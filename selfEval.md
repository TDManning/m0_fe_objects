# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

These particular assignments partaining to Objects, were very straightforward. I was able to reference the Turing Guide to complete them. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

Overall my workflow is good, but I do have room for improvement. I'm doing 1-2 hour chunks of work without a break and I think I need to stop more like every 30 min.- hour. As soon as I submit this I will take a break for a few minutes. 

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? By reviewing the material in advance of its presentation I will be able to follow along and ask better questions, thereby learning it in a more time efficient way.
